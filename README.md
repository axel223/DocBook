# DocBook
Doctor Prescription Application
We Developed an platform where doctor and patient can interact. The Project aims to provide a centralised database with the details
of the patients which can be viewed by the patient and can be accessed by the doctor. The web app aims to ease the task of doctors by providing them single UI with their upcoming appointments and an option to reschedule them. The mobile app gives the user options to book the appointment without any hustle. We used Flutter for this Project.

To Run the DocBook
```
flutter channel beta
flutter upgrade
flutter config --enable-web
flutter devices
```
 if chrome is there 
 then ,
 ```
flutter run -d chrome
```
